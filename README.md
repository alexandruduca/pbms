### Project 4: **Personal Book Management System**
**Problem Statement**:  
"Build a personal book management system where users can track the books they have read, want to read, and where they can buy them. The app should:  
1. **Book Search and Addition**:  
   - Allow users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN using the [Open Library Search API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) or another free/open API.  
   - Display search results with details like title, author, cover image, and description.  
   - Allow users to add books to one of three lists:  
     - **Read**: Books they have already read.  
     - **Want to Read**: Books they plan to read.  
     - **To Buy**: Books they want to purchase.  
2. **Book Details**:  
   - When a book is clicked, display its details (e.g., title, author, cover image, description, ISBN, series, author’s note).  
   - Allow users to edit or remove books from their lists.  
3. **List Management**:  
   - Display the three lists (Read, Want to Read, To Buy) in separate sections or pages.  
   - Allow users to move books between lists (e.g., from 'Want to Read' to 'Read').  
4. **Styling**:  
   - Use CSS or a library like Tailwind, Material-UI, or Angular Material to make the app visually appealing.  
5. **Optional Features**:  
   - Add a dark mode toggle.  
   - Use routing (React Router or Angular Router) for separate pages for each list.  
   - Implement local storage or a simple backend to persist the user’s book lists.  
   - Add filtering or sorting options for the lists (e.g., by author, title, or date added).  

In order to start the application, open a terminal in the /pbms folder and type "npm run dev".
